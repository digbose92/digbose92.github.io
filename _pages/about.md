I am a Research Scientist at <a target="_blank" href="https://research.adobe.com/people/page/1/?location=Bangalore"><b>Adobe Research, Bengaluru</b></a>, where I currently work on improving multi-modal document understanding. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the <a target="_blank" href="https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/"><b>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</b></a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/"><b>University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering</b></a>. I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html"><b>Prof. Shrikanth Narayanan</b></a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sail.usc.edu/"><b>Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory</b></a>. Prior to USC, I worked as a Research Software Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/india/"><b>IBM Research, India</b></a> from 2016 to 2018. I received my Masters in Electrical Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/"><b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</b></a> in 2016, where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/"><b>Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri</b></a>. Previously, I obtained my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/"><strong>Jadavpur University</strong></a> in 2014.

My research interests broadly span across the domains of <b>multimodal machine learning</b>, <b>computer vision</b> and <b>applications of computer vision in healthcare</b>. I am particularly interested in multimodal learning with major focus along the following dimensions:

<ul>
<li><b>Robustness:</b> Improving model performance under adversarial settings including modality corruption.</li>
<li><b>Generalization:</b> Enhancing the generalization capabilities of multi-modal models to novel reasoning tasks across diverse groups/cultures and domains.</li>
<li><b>Explainability:</b> Developing interpretable models for multimodal reasoning tasks.</li>
</ul>
