My research interests broadly span across the domains of <b>multimodal machine learning</b>, <b>affective computing</b> and <b>applications of computer vision in healthcare</b>. I am particularly interested in multimodal learning with major focus along the following dimensions:

<ul>
<li><b>Robustness:</b> Improving model performance under adversarial settings including modality corruption.</li>
<li><b>Generalization:</b> Enhancing the generalization capabilities of multi-modal foundation models to novel reasoning tasks across diverse groups/cultures and domains.</li>
</ul>
