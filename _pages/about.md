My research interests broadly span across the domains of <strong>multimodal machine learning</strong>, <strong>affective computing</strong> and <strong>applications of computer vision in healthcare</strong>. I am particularly interested in multimodal learning with major focus along the following dimensions:

<ul>
<li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Improving model performance under adversarial settings including modality corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Enhancing the generalization capabilities of multi-modal foundation models to novel reasoning tasks across diverse groups/cultures and domains.</li>
</ul>
